# **Hands-On MS Power BI**
## **Case Study: Big Organics**
### Description
A supermarket has a customer loyalty program and is offering a new line of organic products. As an initial
buyer incentive plan, the supermarket provided coupons for the organic products to all the loyalty
program participants and collected data that include whether these customers have purchased any of the
organic products. The supermarketâ€™s management wants to determine which customers are likely to
purchase these organic products.

### Power BI
Power BI is a collection of software services, apps, and connectors that work together to turn your unrelated sources of data into coherent, visually immersive, and interactive insights. Power BI lets you easily connect to your data sources, visualize and discover what's important, and share that with anyone or everyone you want.
For this Case Study I'm using Power BI Desktop a Windows desktop application.
